Components:
-------------
> Components describe a part of the user interface. 
> They are re-usable and can be nested inside other components.
> Components are building blocks of any react app.
> Components code is placed in Javascript or JSX file.


Types of Components: (Refer ES6 functions and classes concept)
----------------------
1) Stateless Functional Components

   function welcome(props)
   {
	return <h1> Hello, {props.name} </h1>;
   }

2) Stateful Class Components

   > Stateful class is a class that extends Component class from the react library.
   > They must contain Render method returning HTML

   class Welcome extends React.Component {
	render() {
		return <h1> Hello, {this.props.name} </h1>;
	}
   }

**Note: After React 16.7.0-alpha version, React team introduced new feature that lets you use state 
	and features without writing a class i.e Hooks. 
	So now there are 2 types of components:
		1) Functional components 2) Class components

Functional Components:
-----------------------
> Functional Components are just javascript functions which optionally recieve an object of properties 
  and returns HTML or JSX which describes UI.

Class Components:
-----------------------
> Class Components are basically ES6 classes optionally recieve props as input and return HTML or JSX.
> A class components can also maintain a private internal state (information to describe UI). 


Functional vs Class Components:
---------------------------------

*Functional Components:
	> Simple Functions
	> Use Func components as much as possible
	> Absence of this keyword
	> Solution without using state (before 16.7.0-alpha v)
	> Mainly responsible for the UI
	> It's also called Stateless/Dumb/Presentational components

*Class Components:
	> More feature rich
	> Maintain their own private data- state
	> Complex UI logic
	> Provide lifecycle hooks
