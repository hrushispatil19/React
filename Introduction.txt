What is React JS?
--------------------
    > React (also known as ReactJS) is a javascript library for building user interfaces. 
      It is maintained by Facebook and community of individual developersand companies.
    > React is used to build user interfaces specifically for single page and mobile applications.
    > React also allows to create reusable UI components.

Setup (SR):
-------
    > Node JS 
    > VS Code

Create React App:
-------------------
    > Go to command prompt
    > Enter below command to create react app
	*Using NPX: (NPX is npm package runner)
        	npx create-react-app <project_name>
	Using NPM:
		> npm install create-react-app -g
		> create-react-app <project_name>
		
      It will create app folder in specified directory.
    > To start created app, enter below command
        npm start
    > To create a production build, use below command
	npm run build.

Folder Structure:
--------------------

package.json: 
    This file holds metadata relevant to the project like project description, version of the project, project dependencies, scripts,
    configuration data, etc.

package-lock.json:
    This file contains all the node modules related details.

node modules folder:
    This is the folder in which all the dependencies are installed. It is generated when we run create react app command.

index.html:
    This is only HTML file in the application which is entry point of our application.


Single page application:
-------------------------
    It's a web application that interacts with user by dynamically rewriting 
    the current page rather than loading entire new pages from a server.

JSX:
-----
    It's a javascript extension. It allows us to define react elements using syntax
    that looks like HTML. 

    Example:
       React syntax:  const element= React.createElements('h1',null,'Hello React');
       JSX syntax  :  const element= <h1> Hello, React </h1>;

DOM vs VIRTUAL DOM:
--------------------
    > DOM is an abstraction of structured text where HTML tags become nodes in the DOM. While HTML is text,
      the DOM is an in-memory representation of this text in the form of nodes. The DOM provides an interface 
      to traverse and modify the nodes.

    > Virtual DOM is an abstraction of the DOM. It is lightweight and detached from the browser specific 
      implementation details.


React DOM:
-----------
    > React relies on Virtual DOM to render elements into the browser.
    > Virtual DOM (VDOM) is a programming concept where UI is kept in memory and synced with real DOM.
    > Virtual DOM are the objects representing the used interface.
